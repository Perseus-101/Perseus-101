# 🗡️ Perseus (aka Denil)

### Hi there! 👋

I'm an aspiring indie full-stack developer and a student pursuing studies in AI at the University of Edinburgh. My journey in computer science began at Fergusson College, Pune, where I honed my skills and developed a deep fascination for the digital world.  

Driven by an insatiable curiosity, my coding projects are built from the ground up, fueled by a relentless passion for exploring and creating my vision of the future, one step at a time.

Join me as I embark on this exciting adventure, constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible!
