**'Digital Craftsman (Developer/Researcher/Visionary)'**

### Hi there! 👋

I'm an aspiring indie full-stack developer and a student pursuing studies in AI at the University of Edinburgh. My journey in computer science began at Fergusson College, Pune, where I developed a deep fascination for the digital world. All coding projects are built from the ground up, fueled by a relentless curiosity for exploring and creating my vision of the future, one step at a time.
